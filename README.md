# NCAAMarchMadness

A web application containing 2015-2019 March Madness tournaments. Full stack built with PHP and SQLite

Note that XAMPP (MAMP for Mac) or equivalent web server solution is needed to run this application

## How to Run

1. Have all `608_php` files into the `htdocs` folder
2. Run MAMP / XAMPP and start servers. This will launch the MAMP / XAMPP homepage
3. Clone repo and navigate to http://localhost:8888/ncaa-march-madness/index.php

## Next Steps

1. Fix password authentication on Admin page

2. Create methods for bulk insertions and deletions

3. Build ML pipes using Spark RDDs to predict future tournament results

4. Remove db file from git tracking (currently there for learning purposes)
